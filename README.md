# ASCII-Image-Converter
A python program that takes any image and convert to ASCII characters

Warning: Larger images files can have trouble displaying, wil still convert but will get distorter due to limited screen space. I found that around 50-100 pixel of width is good, and the more squared an image is also improves viewing.
